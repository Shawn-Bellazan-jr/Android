To include `uui` in your project, you can add the module directly or, in the future, integrate it via a package manager like **Jitpack** (once hosted).

### Manual Integration

1. Download or clone the `uui` library into your Android Studio project.
2. Add the following dependency to your **app-level** `build.gradle`:

```gradle

fun MyScreen() {
    PrimaryButton(text = "Submit", onClick = { /* Handle submit */ })
}
```

### 2. **Outlined Button**
A secondary button with an outline.

```kotlin
import com.example.ui.base.OutlinedButton

@Composable
fun MyScreen() {
    OutlinedButton(text = "Cancel", onClick = { /* Handle cancel */ })
}
```

### 3. **Input Form**
A reusable form with validation logic.

```kotlin
import com.example.ui.composite.InputForm

@Composable
fun MyFormScreen() {
    InputForm(onSubmit = { input -> 
        // Handle form submission
    })
}
```

### 4. **Custom Dialog**
A dialog box with customizable title, content, and actions.

```kotlin
import com.example.ui.composite.CustomDialog

@Composable
fun MyDialog() {
    CustomDialog(
        title = "Delete Item",
        content = "Are you sure you want to delete this item?",
        onDismiss = { /* Handle dismiss */ },
        onConfirm = { /* Handle confirm */ }
    )
}
```

### 5. **Theming**
Customize the look and feel with dark mode support and a cohesive typography system.
